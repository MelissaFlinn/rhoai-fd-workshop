= 2.3 Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

NOTE: If you're already at ease with Jupyter, you can xref:2-04-experiment-train.adoc[skip to the next section].

A notebook is an environment where you have _cells_ that can display formatted text or code.
+
This is an empty cell:

+
This is a cell with some code:

Code cells contain Python code that can be run interactively. You can modify the code and then run it. The code does not run on your computer or in the browser, but directly in the environment that you are connected to, *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* in our case.

You can run a code cell from the notebook interface or from the keyboard:

* From the user interface: Select the cell (by clicking inside the cell or to the left side of the cell) and then click *Run/Play* from the toolbar.
+

* From the keyboard: Press `CTRL`+`Enter` to run a cell or press `Shift`+`Enter`` to run the cell and automatically select the following one.

After you run the cell, you can see the result of the code that was run in that cell, as well as information on when the cell was run as shwon in this example:

When you save a notebook, the code as well as the results are saved. This means that you can reopen it to look at the results without having to run the program again, while still having access to the code.

Notebooks are so named because they are just like a physical *Notebook*: it's exactly like if you were to take notes about your experiments (which you will do), along with the code itself, including any parameters that you set. You can see the output of the experiment inline (this is the result from a cell once it's run), along with all the notes that you want to take (to do that, switch the cell type from the menu from `Code` to `Markup`).

== Try It

Now that you have covered the basics, give it a try!

.Prerequisite

* You have imported the workshop files into your Jupyter environment as described in 
xref:2-02-jupyter-env.adoc[section 2.2]

.Procedure

image::workbenches/jupyter-notebook-0.png[Notebook 0]

. In your Jupyter environment, locate the `0_sandbox.ipynb` file. 
. Double-click it to launch the notebook. The notebook opens in a new tab in the content section of the environment. 
. Experiment by, for example, running the existing cells, adding more cells and creating functions.
+
You can do what you want - it's your environment and there is no risk of breaking anything or impacting other users. This environment isolation is also a great advantage brought by OpenShift Data Science.
. Optionally, create a new notebook where the code cells will be run by using a Python 3 kernel:
.. Create a new notebook by either selecting *File ->New ->Notebook* or by clicking on the icon in the launcher:
+
image::workbenches/new_notebook.png[alt text]
//check/verify this step 
.. Select a Python 3 kernel. 

You can use different kernels, with different languages or versions that you can run in your notebook.
