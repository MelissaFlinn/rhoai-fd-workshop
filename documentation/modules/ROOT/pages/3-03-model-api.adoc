= 2.3 Testing the Model API

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that you've deployed the model, you can look at its API endpoints.

When creating the model server, you did *not* create a route for external access to the API and you did not protect it with an auth token. As a result of not specifying external access, the model server provides an internal endpoint with no authentication. 

.Prerequiste

* Locate information about the service and the model by hovering over *?* next to the model name (`fraud`) and *Internal Service* for endpoint identifiers.

You can communicate directly with this internal service in the same way that an application in your project would. One of the easiest way to do test it, is from a notebook in the same project.

.Next step

Let's go back to the Jupyter environment and try out our new endpoint.  You'll try REST API calls in `4_rest_requests.ipynb` and gRPC requests in `5_grpc_requests.ipynb`.
