= 2.2 Deploying the data model

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that the data model is accessible in storage and saved in a portable `onnx` format, you can use an {productname-short} model server to deploy it as an API.

{productname-short} multi-model servers can host several models at once.  You create a new model server and deploy your model to it.

.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to *Models and model servers*.
. Click *Add server*.

. In the form:

.. Fill out the *Model server name*, for example `Model Server`.
.. Select `OpenVINO Model Server`.
.. Leave the other fields (replicas, size, route, auth) with their default settings.

.. Enter the path to your uploaded model: `models/fraud/model.onnx`

. Take note of the API Endpoint name and URL. You need this information in the next section when you test the model.
